# BraMARS
Brain metastasis (BM) remains a major cause of mortality and morbidity in limited-stage small cell lung cancer (LS-SCLC). While prophylactic cranial irradiation (PCI) is a common preventive treatment, its benefit-risk balance is suboptimal due to significant neurotoxicity, highlighting the urgent need for personalized risk stratification tools. In this study, we present BraMARS, a histopathology-based deep learning model for personalized BM risk prediction and PCI treatment optimization from H&E-stained whole-slide images.
